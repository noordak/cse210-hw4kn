# cse210-ww-student-template
This is the pain in my butt because I cannot push it to Git. I wonder if it is like this for students in the worldwide content version of CSE 210.

This repository contains the starter code for many different projects. They are arranged folders by week. There is also an an empty sandbox project that can be used to play around with any concept you would like.

I hope I can figure this out because I might have to drop the class otherwise.
